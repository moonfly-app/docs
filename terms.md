By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our Services.

### 1\. Your Access to the Services

Children under the age of 14 are not allowed to create an Account or otherwise use the Services. Additionally, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to create an account or otherwise use the Services.

In addition, certain of our Services or portions of our Services require you to be 18 years of age or older, so please read all notices and any Additional Terms carefully when you access the Services.

If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or government entity, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind such entity to these Terms.

### 2\. Content Guidelines

When using or accessing our Services, you agree to follow our [Content Guidelines](https://www.moonfly.app/!/content-guidelines).

### 3\. Your Use of the Services

We grant you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to use and access the Services solely as permitted by these Terms. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms.

Except as permitted through the Services or as otherwise permitted by us in writing, your license does not include the right to:

*   license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or Content;
*   modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services or Content; or
*   access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service, except as permitted by our official API.

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice to you. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Services will be subject to these Terms, which may be updated from time to time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.

### 4\. Your Account and Account Security

To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create an account on our platform (an "Account") and provide us with an e-mail address, username, password, display name and certain other information about yourself.

You are solely responsible for the information associated with your Account and anything that happens related to your Account. You must maintain the security of your Account and immediately change your password if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your permission. We recommend that you use a strong password that is used only with your Account and enable two-factor authentication.

### 5\. Your Content

The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, or other materials ("Content"), including Content created or submitted to the Services by you or through your Account ("Your Content"). We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, support, or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any of Your Content.

By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights.

You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant us the following license to use that Content:

When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world. This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with us.

You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.

Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about us or our Services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that we may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.

Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason, including for violating these Terms, violating our Content Guidelines, or if you otherwise create or are likely to create liability for us.

### 6\. Third-Party Content, Advertisements, and Promotions

The Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services, which may be posted by advertisers, our affiliates, our partners, or other users ("Third-Party Content"). Third-Party Content is not under our control, and we are not responsible for any third party’s websites, products, or services. Your use of Third-Party Content is at your own risk and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Content.

The Services may also contain sponsored Third-Party Content or advertisements. The type, degree, and targeting of advertisements are subject to change, and you acknowledge and agree that we may place advertisements in connection with the display of any Content or information on the Services, including Your Content.

If you choose to use the Services to conduct a promotion, including a contest or sweepstakes ("Promotion"), you alone are responsible for conducting the Promotion in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at your own risk. Your Promotion must state that the Promotion is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with us, and the rules for your Promotion must require each entrant or participant to release us from any liability related to the Promotion.

In addition to these Terms, by purchasing or using our Paid Services, you further agree to their respective terms and conditions.

We may change the fees or benefits associated with the Paid Services from time to time with reasonable advance notice of material changes; provided, however, that no advance notice will be required for temporary promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees associated with the Paid Services.

The limitations of this section will apply to any theory of liability, including those based on warranty, contract, statute, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, and even if the Our Entities have been advised of the possibility of any such damage, and even if any remedy set forth herein is found to have failed its essential purpose. The foregoing limitation of liability will apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.

If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop accessing and using our Services before the changes become effective.

### 16\. Additional Terms

To the extent any Additional Terms conflict with these Terms, the Additional Terms govern with respect to your use of the corresponding Service.

### 17\. Termination

You may terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your Account and discontinuing use of all Services. If you stop using the Services without deactivating your Account, your Account may be deactivated due to prolonged inactivity.
