### How We Collect Information

#### Information provided directly by you

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, you share information directly with us when you create an account, fill out a form, submit or post content through our Services, purchase a membership, communicate with us via third-party platforms, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of personal information we may collect include your name, display name, username, bio, email address, business information, your content, including your avatar image, photos, posts, responses, and series published by you, and any other information you choose to provide.

In some cases, we may also collect information you provide about others, such as when you create an advertising campaign for a third party. We will use this information to fulfill your request and will not send communications to your contacts unrelated to your request, unless they separately consent to receive communications from us or otherwise engage with us.

We do not collect payment information through our Services. We rely on third parties to process payments in connection with our Services. Any information you provide to facilitate such a payment is subject to the third-party payment processor’s privacy policy, and we encourage you to review this policy before you provide any information to the payment processor.

#### Information We Collect Automatically When You Interact with Us

In some instances, we automatically collect certain information, including:

*   **Activity Information:** We collect information about your activity on our Services, such as your reading history and when you share links, follow users, highlight posts, and interact with posts.
*   **Transactional Information:** When you purchase a membership, we collect information about the transaction, such as subscription details, purchase price, and the date of the transaction.
*   **Device and Usage Information:** We collect information about how you access our Services, including data about the device and network you use, such as your hardware model, operating system version, mobile network, IP address, unique device identifiers, browser type, and app version. We also collect information about your activity on our Services, such as access times, pages viewed, links clicked, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.
*   **Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies:** We use tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect information about you. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits. Web beacons (also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") are electronic images that we may use on our Services and in our emails to help deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage. We also work with third party analytics providers who use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Services and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in mobile apps, and links clicked. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver content targeted to your interests on our Services, and better understand your online activity. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see Your Choices below.

#### Information We Collect from Other Sources

We obtain information from third-party sources. For example, when you use the Connect with PayPal (also known as Login with PayPal) service to verify your identity in order to be able to receive payments, we will collect your name, address, PayPal e-mail address, your PayPal account ID and verified status. We do not collect any information regarding your PayPal balance, payments history, payment cards or bank account numbers.

#### Information We Derive

We may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the information we collect. For example, we may make inferences about your location based on your IP address or infer reading preferences based on your reading history.

### Use of Information

We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve our Services, which includes publishing and distributing user-generated content, personalizing the posts you see and operating our subscription service. We also use the information we collect to:

*   Create and maintain your account;
*   Process transactions and send related information, such as confirmations, receipts, and user experience surveys;
*   Send you technical notices, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;
*   Respond to your comments and questions and provide customer service;
*   Communicate with you about new content, products, services, and features offered by us and provide other news and information we think will interest you (see Your Choices below for information about how to opt out of these communications at any time);
*   To show you relevant advertising;
*   Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services;
*   To research and innovate;
*   Detect, investigate, and prevent security incidents and other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity and protect the rights and property of all stakeholders;
*   Debug to identify and repair errors in our Services;
*   Comply with our legal and financial obligations; and
*   Carry out any other purpose described to you at the time the information was collected.

### Sharing of Information

We share personal information in the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this policy:

*   When you make something public. For example, if you use our Services to publish content, post comments or send private notes, certain information about you will be visible to others, such as your display name, photo, bio, other account information you may provide, and information about your activities on our Services (e.g., your followers and who you follow, recent posts, reactions, highlights, and responses).
*   We share personal information with vendors, service providers, and consultants that need access to personal information in order to perform services for us, such as companies that assist us with web hosting, storage, and other infrastructure, analytics, payment processing, fraud prevention and security, customer service, communications, marketing, etc.
*   When you use another company's service that connects to us, like voice-enabled devices and connected TV.
*   When we do collaborative research. We do research activities and sometimes collaborate with research partners. Every now and then we share our content and data with them. This might include information we’ve collected about you. But we’re careful about what we share and what our research partners can do with it.
*   We may disclose personal information if we believe that disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We will object to legal requests for information about users of our Services that we believe are improper.
*   We may share personal information with the relevant authority, institution or organization if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, if we believe that you have violated the law, or if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of the platform, our users, the public, or others.
*   We share personal information with our lawyers and other professional advisors where necessary to obtain advice or otherwise protect and manage our business interests.
*   We may share personal information in connection with, or during negotiations concerning, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.
*   Personal information is shared between and among us and our current and future parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries and other companies under common control and ownership.
*   We also share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

### Third-Party Embeds

We do not host some of the content displayed on our Services. Users have the ability to post content that is actually hosted by a third party, but is embedded in our pages (an "Embed"). When you interact with an Embed, it can send information about your interaction to the hosting third party just as if you were visiting the third party’s site directly. For example, when you load a post with a YouTube video Embed and watch the video, YouTube receives information about your activity, such as your IP address and how much of the video you watch. We do not control what information third parties collect through Embeds or what they do with the information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through Embeds. The privacy policy belonging to the third party hosting the Embed applies to any information the Embed collects, and we recommend you review that policy before interacting with the Embed.

### Your Choices

#### Account Information

You may access, correct, delete and export your account information at any time by logging into the Services. Please note that if you choose to delete your account, we may continue to retain certain information about you as required by law or for our legitimate business purposes. Your public comments, posts and other activity may continue to be accessible online after the deletion of your account.

#### Cookies

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually adjust your browser settings to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.

Some of the reasons we use cookies.

*   To remember information about you, so you don't have to give it to us again.
*   To keep you logged in, even on different devices
*   To help us understand how people are using our services, so we can make them better to deliver relevant advertising.
*   To help us personalize the content you see by remembering your preferences and settings.

#### Communications Preferences

You may opt out of receiving certain communications from us, such as digests, newsletters, and activity notifications, by following the instructions in those communications or through your account’s settings. If you opt out, we may still send you administrative emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.

#### Mobile Push Notifications

With your consent, we may send push notifications to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.

### Additional Disclosures for Individuals in Europe
