Monetization Agreement
----------------------

Effective as of November 5th, 2022.

This Monetization Agreement ("Terms" or "Monetization Agreement") between Pentadrive OÜ ("we", "us", or "our") and you, governs the monetization of your posts and comments ("Content") in the context of the websites, mobile apps, widgets, APIs, emails, and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services" or "Platform") provided by us. By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

### Eligibility for Monetization

When you register an Account and are a resident of an eligible country (as listed in the relevant section of Account settings), you may be eligible to receive revenue based on the performance of your Content.

By saving or modifying your payment settings, you agree to these Terms, as well as our User Agreement, Privacy Policy, Content Guidelines, Moderator Guidelines and all other terms and conditions that apply to our Services. Please read these Terms carefully. If you don’t understand them, or don’t accept any part of them, then you can’t monetize your content. Your acceptance of these Terms forms a binding agreement between you and us and shows your intent to be bound by them.

Your content must be selected by our algorithm or us in order to be monetized. We reserve the right to admit your content at our sole discretion. Eligibility requirements are subject to change at any time and may not be disclosed to you in order to protect the integrity of the Platform.

Ongoing eligibility for monetization is subject but not limited to maintaining your account in good standing. A key component to maintaining your account in good standing is adhering to our Content Guidelines and Moderator Guidelines.

### Termination

We reserve the right to demonetize any or all of your content at any time, which will end its ability to generate revenue. We reserve the right at our sole discretion to disable your ability to receive any revenue under these Terms, suspend or terminate your participation in this Monetization Agreement at any time for any reason, including but not limited to being a resident of a uneligible country, violation of our Content Guidelines, Moderator Guidelines or any terms contained herein.

If your participation in this Monetization Agreement is terminated for any reason, your content can no longer generate revenue.

### Estimated Revenue Tracking

You may be able to track your estimated revenue and pending payments, but the amounts shown are subject to adjustments including but not limited to currency fluctuations, taxes and fees, and not guaranteed to be paid out.

### Payment

To accrue or receive payment of any revenues under these Terms, your Account must be in good standing (meaning for example, your monetization is not currently disabled, you are not currently suspended, you are not violating Terms or have not violated the Terms, or have not been terminated) and have at all times an active Account. To receive payment you must have an active payout method associated with your Account at all times. We do not owe you any revenue that may be associated with your content during any period when your Account is not in good standing or you do not have a valid Account. You will not receive any revenue if you do not have a payout account in a country eligible for monetization. We reserve the right to require that your revenue meets a minimum payout threshold before we disburse any payment. In the event that you quit or are removed from the Platform, you will lose all unpaid revenue.

### Changes or Discontinuation of Monetization Agreement

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue these Terms. We will not be liable to you or any third party for any such modification, suspension, or termination. We may change these Terms from time to time so we encourage you to periodically review this page for the most up-to-date version.

### Taxes

If required by law, you are solely responsible for reporting and paying any applicable taxes in connection with your participation in these Terms. Such taxes may include duties, customs fees, income tax or any other taxes, along with any related penalties or interest.

### Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and defend us, our affiliates, agents, and advertisers from and against any and all third-party claims and liabilities arising out of or related to your Content or Account; your use of the Services; or your breach of any term of these Terms. Our advertisers are third-party beneficiaries of this indemnity.

### Limitation of Liability

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EXCEPT FOR ANY INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR YOUR BREACH OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS, AND/OR PROPRIETARY INTERESTS RELATING TO THESE TERMS, (i) IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE UNDER THESE TERMS FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER THEORY, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY, AND (ii) EACH PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS IS LIMITED TO THE NET AMOUNT RECEIVED AND RETAINED BY THAT PARTICULAR PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE CLAIM. Each party acknowledges that the other party has entered into these Terms relying on the limitations of liability stated herein and that those limitations are an essential basis of the bargain between the parties.

### Governing Law & Forum

The governing law, mandatory forum, and dispute resolution provisions of our User Agreement also apply to these Terms and any dispute arising under them.

### Miscellaneous

You participate in this Monetization Agreement at your own risk. You agree that you are solely responsible for your actions in connection with these Terms, any breach of your obligations under these Terms, and for the consequences of any such breach.

Any capitalized terms used but not defined in these Terms have the meanings given to them in our User Agreement. Except as modified by these Terms, our User Agreement remains in effect. Our right to modify or revise the User Agreement also applies to this Monetization Agreement.
